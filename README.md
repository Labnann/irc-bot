# irc-bot

Created using [discord-irc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-irc).

Run:

```
cd irc-bot
mv .env.example .env

You need to create a Discord bot user, which you can do by following the
instructions [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).

When you have the app token and channel ids, you can proceed to change
the .env file.

Then, install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

After that: Start the bot with
```
npm start
```
